This is my personal project I do for fun. I want to make a video game from Scratch only using C#. There will be some bugs and issues because I am doing this for fun.

I developed this program in Visual Studio 2019 and I build and run it using Visual Studio 2019. Sadly, I have only tested it on my machine which is windows 10.

# About the Game
You explore a randomized maze with infinite floors. Each floor will contain treasure and monsters, fighting monsters will grant you XP to make you stronger for subsequent fights. However, each floor will contain more monsters than you can handle; thus, you have to balance fighting monsters to get stronger while not being defeated in the process. If you are defeated you have to restart. See how many floors you can reach before you inevitably fall to the monsters.

## What I have Achieved so Far
- It creates a randomized maze when you start the program. The maze only has two different rooms currently. It will be updated with more rooms
- Monsters spawn in the maze and they will chase the player. When the monsters 'grab' the player...
- Combat starts, which for now is quite repetitive
